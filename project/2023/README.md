# Project - 2022 SM2

### Project Overview

In this subject, we will discuss a variety of design principles and architectural patterns for enterprise applications. 
In this project, students will have the opportunity to gain practical experience in the implementation of these patterns 
by developing a large-scale enterprise application. 

The project aims to give students the experience to:
* Produce an architectural design for an enterprise system.
* Choose suitable design patterns to be applied for the different architectural layers.
* Implement an application for your design. 
* Develop employability skills: teamwork, good communication, collaboration, problem-solving, critical-thinking, 
adaptability, initiative and leadership.
